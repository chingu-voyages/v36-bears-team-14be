# Essen - Recipes App (Back end)

## About
Essen is a social recipe app where the user can sign up, login and create a profile.  Once logged in, the user can add recipes including ingredients, directions and an image.  The user may like other user's recipes.  The app is a collaboration through the Chingu organization which allows developers to develop technical, team building and mentorship skills.

2. Run npm i
3. Extra installation that may be required:
